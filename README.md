# Text-Summarization

### Introduction
Text summarization is essential in various fields such as information retrieval, news aggregation, and document management. By summarizing long documents into concise and coherent summaries, users can quickly grasp the main points without reading the entire text.

### Types of Text Summarization
There are two main types of text summarization techniques:

### Extractive Summarization
Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences, phrases, or sections from the original text and piecing them together to create a summary. The goal is to identify the most critical parts of the text without altering the original sentences.

### Tools and Libraries
Several tools and libraries are available for text summarization:

transformer : A simple library for extractive summarization.
transformers: A library by Hugging Face that provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks, including summarization.
nltk: An open-source library for advanced NLP tasks.
pytorch: an open-source deep learning framework
